    <h2>Recipe by Syeda Abbas</h2>
    
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 oz fettuccine pasta</li>
        <li>2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>

    </ul>

        <li>Season chicken breasts with salt and pepper.</li>
